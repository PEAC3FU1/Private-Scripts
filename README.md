# Peac3fu1’s 3D Models

Hey! This is where I keep all the 3D models I’ve made or cleaned up.  
Mostly Blender files, ready to mess around with or throw into your game.

## What’s here?

| Model          | Who Made It | What I Did                      | Status     |
|----------------|-------------|--------------------------------|------------|
| Player Model   | n3b20251    | Fixed weights, renamed bones, cleaned stuff up | Updated    |

## What’s fixed / changed?

- Weight painting got some love, so it moves better  
- Bones got renamed so they make sense  
- Outliner cleaned — no more messy Blender scene  
- Textures and UVs fixed up  
- Added some lights and cameras for quick renders  
- Made it easy to export to Unity, Godot, Unreal, whatever
